# Change some file's icon to VS Code Icons

I created this repo because maybe you have the same problem with me. You uninstalled vs code but still want to use the icons for some files like `.json`, `.js`, etc. My case is that I uninstalled vs code and migrated to the portable version.

First, you can find vs code icon path on vs code installation. I found it in `VSCode-installationfolder\resources\app\resources\win32`. And then change the `$baseIconPath` variable value on the script, and then run the script using administrator powershell. You can ask AI for that if you are still confused.

I will save the icons on this repo if you can't find the icon path.
